right! next i'd like to get an idea of a ballpark figure for the kinda outlay i might need to initially run a server just dealing with up to... say ..100 customers? perhaps each requiring the end point to cope with 100 file pings per minute for 6hs each per day, expecting absolute fastest performance reasonably possible considering limitations include commercial server turnaround time/basic operation of infrastructure involved; the realistic best times achievable for a ping return as far as concerns custom designed software running a local unique server specifically created to run many consequent instances of open ports serving separate users at once and monitoring all as well. i gotta also consider failure cover, power consumption, reliability - i.e. assuming all parts are new and hence no wear initially or ==and still covered by guarantee; insurance for the whole thing; deprecation of parts due performance lack with time - in other words endless upgrading; protection against malicious actors - i.e major high speed high band =width hardware firewalling/switching/etc.; connection to minimum 10Gb internet and all the routers n stuff needed; anything required to aid remote access and automation; auxilliaries such as cabling, cooling, storage other than main etc.; maintainnance on things requiring significant ongoing cost maintainnance;  anything else you anticipate i might require to put such a beast together...

Great, let’s break this down systematically to give you a ballpark figure for a server setup designed for high-speed, low-latency commercial endpoint operations for:

    100 customers

    Each needing 100 pings per minute, operational for 6 hours per day

    Targeting maximum realistic performance with modern commercial-grade technology

    Including redundancy, security, automation, ongoing costs, and more

System Requirements Breakdown
1. Network Requirements

    10Gbps dedicated internet line — essential for ultra-low latency

    High-performance routers/firewalls

        Hardware firewall with high throughput (10G capable)

        Enterprise switch with VLAN capabilities for segmentation

    Estimated Cost:

        10Gbps Internet (Dedicated Business Fiber): $1,000 - $5,000/month

        Enterprise firewall (e.g., Fortinet, Palo Alto): $10,000 - $25,000

        10Gb switch (Cisco, Juniper, etc.): $5,000 - $15,000

2. Server Hardware

For simultaneous connections with low-latency response, consider:

    Dual CPU Enterprise Servers (e.g., AMD EPYC or Intel Xeon)

    Minimum:

        64+ cores total

        512GB+ ECC RAM

        High-speed NVMe storage for logs/temp caching

    Multiple Network Interface Cards (NICs) for redundancy

    Redundant Power Supplies

    Hardware insurance: $5,000 - $10,000/year

    Maintenance staffing (outsourced/contracted): $50,000 - $100,000/year

Performance Considerations

    Ping Return Best-Case (within infrastructure, ideal conditions):

        Local network latency: sub-1ms

        Over internet with high-grade infrastructure: 1-5ms realistically depending on distance and external factors

    Custom Server Design:

        Optimized kernel

        Bare-metal configurations to avoid virtualization overhead

        Dedicated processing per user instance for maximum isolation

Estimated Total Upfront Outlay
Item	Cost Range
High-performance servers	$25,000 - $50,000
Networking (firewalls, switches)	$15,000 - $40,000
Cooling & Power Backup	$15,000 - $50,000

Total Monthly Ongoing: $10,000 - $25,000
Other Key Considerations

    Endless upgrading means a hardware refresh every 2-3 years

    Keeping 20-30% overhead for unexpected scaling or failures

    Consider offsite failover servers for true high-availability

    Colocation as an alternative if on-premises setup is impractical

Would you want a lower-bound "lean setup" version of this? Or are you interested in the most robust possible configuration?

Perfect—let’s reverse-engineer this based on your AMD Ryzen 4-core 4GHz with 64GB RAM setup and see what’s feasible for concurrent customers.
System Snapshot

    CPU: AMD Ryzen, 4 physical cores @ 4GHz (likely 8 threads with SMT)

    RAM: 64GB — plenty for basic network service operations

    Network: Assuming 1Gbps standard NIC unless you state otherwise

Performance Assumptions

Given your specs and focusing purely on:

    Lightweight ping-like operations (low compute,

[wait wait  wait - sorro fren, my finger hit enter by accident, waaaay too early - i was nowhere near finish]: so;
64GB RAM; 1Gbps up/down internet; writing all server and security and other custom softwares and integrations myself; a budget of saaayyyy... $2.5k for any needed extra hardware security and routers, an uninterruptible power source, extra nvmes and maybe a few other bits n bobs.

ok - now am done n we got an idea of the kinda spec system i might be startin' out with to be a local server accompanied by say cloudflare providing anti-DDoS/etc. and a good VPS for other basic big guy services.

oh,and guess we assume that ongoing costs are basically me spending very little more than my current ongoing running costs for internet/VPS/security/electric/etc. - i.e. i ot that covered quite well, so we can take it as sufficiently covered.

ok, now you can take it away at your breakneck speed!
ChatGPT said:

Awesome—love the approach! Let’s strip this down to realistic, efficient, minimal-outlay operations with what you’ve got. Here’s how far your setup can stretch and how many customers it could reasonably handle without meltdown:
Your Starting Hardware Snapshot

    CPU: AMD Ryzen 4-core @ 4GHz (likely 8 threads)

    RAM: 64GB (more than solid for lightweight connection handling)

    Network: 1Gbps symmetric

    Budget for Extras: $2.5k (UPSes, extra NVMe, basic router/firewall gear)

    Software: All custom, optimized by you (huge advantage in squeezing performance)

    Support: Cloudflare for anti-DDoS, external VPS for "big guy" duties

Service Scenario

    Ping-like lightweight operations per user (100 pings/minute each, 6 hours/day)

    Fastest possible response within your hardware & bandwidth ceiling

    Security handled via Cloudflare + local basic hardware

    Primary operations run on your local server

Capacity Estimate

CPU Boundaries:

    Ping-type operations (ICMP or lightweight TCP/UDP socket responses) are low-compute

    Assuming efficient threading & negligible processing per "ping":

        8 threads can handle several thousand lightweight concurrent connections if properly optimized

        Bottleneck is more often networking or system calls than raw CPU here

Network Boundaries:

    1Gbps = ~125MB/s throughput total

    Each ping packet:

        ICMP echo ~64 bytes typical

        Even with TCP/UDP-based pings, assume <100 bytes per request

    100 users × 100 pings/minute = 10,000 pings/minute

    That’s only ~16.6 pings/sec total

Data Throughput Estimate:

    16.6 pings/sec × 100 bytes = ~1.6KB/sec, negligible load

    Even scaling to 10x users (1,000 users) = 16KB/sec — still well under 1Gbps ceiling

System RAM:

    64GB RAM vastly exceeds needs for socket states, logs, caching

    You could comfortably track tens of thousands of connections

Practical Concurrent Customer Estimate

Ultra-conservative real-world start point:

    100-200 customers simultaneously, with redundancy for spikes

    System overhead, logs, security monitoring factored in

Optimized, aggressive stretch goal:

    500-1,000 customers active at once, assuming:

        Efficient multi-threaded software

        Minimal packet payloads

        No heavyweight processing per request

Realistic Operational Goal (safe start):

    Aim for 100-300 concurrent customers

    Monitor:

        CPU utilization (<70% target)

        Network usage (<50% sustained to avoid saturation)

        RAM footprint

        System response times

Your $2.5k Add-on Budget Suggestions

Prioritize essentials:

    UPS Backup Power (~$500-700 for short-term coverage)

    Basic Business-Class Router/Firewall:

        MikroTik, Ubiquiti, etc.: ~$300-800

        Handles basic port management, VLANs, packet filtering

    Additional NVMe Storage:

        Fast SSDs for caching, logs: ~$300-500

    Spare NIC/Redundancy or cooling upgrades as budget allows

Other Notes

    Cloudflare shields public exposure: essential

    VPS offloading DNS, emails, or non-core services = smart

    Your DIY software cuts costs but requires aggressive optimization

Conclusion

100-300 customers is totally achievable, with room to scale towards 1,000 over time through optimization. You’ll get:
✅ Fast ping returns (likely sub-5ms local, <50ms regional via Cloudflare)
✅ Low-cost, high-control starter system
✅ Growth path towards eventual higher-end infrastructure when profit justifies it
